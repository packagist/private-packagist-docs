# Authentication with Email Addresses and Passwords
## Private Packagist Self-Hosted

## Setup
By default, authentication with email addresses and passwords is disabled. If possible, we recommend setting up authentication with your installation of [GitHub (Enterprise)](./github-integration-setup.md), [Bitbucket.org](./bitbucket-integration-setup.md), [Bitbucket Data Center / Server](./bitbucket-server-integration-setup.md), or [GitLab](./gitlab-integration-setup.md) using OAuth instead.

Navigate to the _Global Configuration_ section from the admin page to get to the form below.
Enable login and account registration with email addresses and passwords by selecting the option in the form and submitting the form via the _Update configuration_ button.
